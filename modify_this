In my work at DWP, I was responsible for leading test assurance for a significant data migration initiative. This role required deep engagement with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I frequently collaborated with DSDs, DMs, and ETL Developers to understand technical specifications, validate that data design reflected business needs, and ensure that acceptance criteria were aligned with user expectations. I have translated those conversations into actionable test cases and worked closely with end users to guide them through what changes would mean from a functional perspective.

To communicate effectively across stakeholder groups, I adopted a tailored approach based on the audience throughout my career:

For technical team, I used tools like JIRA and Confluence extensively for test management, documentation, and collaboration. I’ve created detailed test plans, defect logs, and user documentation in Confluence that were reused across projects. One of my key contributions was streamlining the validation process for over 200 HDFS tables using shell scripting, significantly reducing manual effort. I possess a strong working knowledge of SQL and HQL, developed through my roles in data warehouse testing, ETL development, and big data assurance. My hands-on experience includes writing and optimizing complex queries in Hive, and Impala to validate data integrity, identify anomalies, and support performance testing. 

For business stakeholders and product owners, I have prepared PowerPoint and Excel dashboards to summarize test progress, highlight risks, and highlighting the business impact of technical issues. These visual reports were designed to be non-technical, using charts and annotated visuals to ensure the message was clear and concise. In stakeholder meetings, I walked-through these slides to explain anomalies, defect root causes, and resolutions in plain language, and invited feedback to ensure alignment.

For more formal communication and escalations, I have created structured reports and maintained RAID logs using Excel and Word, which were shared with senior stakeholders to track issues requiring strategic decisions or resource allocation.
My key achievements were during a beta assurance phase where data discrepancies were impacting downstream reporting, I conducted RCAs and discovered logic flaws in transformation rules applied in Hive queries. I documented the issue with screenshots, query results, and impact analysis, and presented it during a stakeholder review. My ability to explain the issue in both technical and business terms enabled swift action and resolution. 

Additionally, I ensured continuous feedback loops by organizing "Show and Tell" sessions after each sprint, where I presented outcomes, demonstrated automation results, or walked through test dashboards. These sessions allowed stakeholders to provide input, clarify expectations, and course-correct early.

My roles have required regular interaction with cross-functional teams and business stakeholders. I’ve effectively translated business needs into technical requirements, validated data models against user expectations, and participated in User Acceptance Testing. A notable achievement includes my work at DWP, where I led the test strategy for a large-scale data migration project, collaborated closely with Data Solution Designers and Developers, and helped resolve issues that directly impacted end users.



Leadership and improvement have been consistent themes throughout my career. From mentoring junior engineers to leading ETL testing teams and introducing QA process improvements, I’ve shown a proactive approach to leadership. I championed automation in multiple environments, driving efficiency, scalability, and quality. My leadership has also extended to strategic planning—such as defining the QA roadmap, identifying process inefficiencies, and delivering scalable automation solutions. I’ve often taken the initiative to document and disseminate new practices across teams to encourage continuous learning and standardization.

I’ve extensive experience collaborating with technical colleagues such as DM, SDs, and ETL Engineers. In these engagements, I’ve ensured that business requirements were properly translated into technical designs and that data pipelines reflected the real needs of users. This has included reviewing ETL specification documents, ensured data quality, and facilitating “Show & Tell” sessions to present solutions and gathering feedback.

I bring a deeply analytical mindset, honed through years of working with data. I understand the critical role data plays in decision-making, performance tracking, and business process optimization. I’ve applied this through continuous performance monitoring, test automation, and root cause identification.

In conclusion, I offer a rare combination of technical expertise, stakeholder engagement, and a relentless drive for improvement. My experience, adaptability, and commitment to quality uniquely position me to contribute as a Business Analyst in your team, ensuring data-driven insights and effective solutions that align with business goals.
