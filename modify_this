In my work at DWP, I was responsible for leading test assurance for a significant data migration initiative. This role required deep engagement with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I frequently collaborated with DSDs, DMs, and ETL Developers to understand technical specifications, validate that data design reflected business needs, and ensure that acceptance criteria were aligned with user expectations. I translated those conversations into actionable test cases and worked closely with end users to guide them through what changes would mean from a functional perspective.
To communicate effectively across stakeholder groups, I adopted a tailored approach based on the audience throughout my career:
For technical teams, I used tools like JIRA and Confluence extensively for test management, documentation, and collaboration. I created detailed test plans, defect logs, and user documentation in Confluence that were reused across projects. One of my key contributions was streamlining the validation process for over 200 HDFS tables using shell scripting, significantly reducing manual effort. I possess a strong working knowledge of SQL and HQL, developed through my roles in data warehouse testing, ETL development, and big data assurance. My hands-on experience includes writing and optimizing complex queries in Hive and Impala to validate data integrity, identify anomalies, and support performance testing.
I also led the testing of Qlik dashboards and other data visualisations to ensure that reports accurately reflected source data and business logic. This involved validating transformation logic end-to-end—from source ingestion to presentation layer—by cross-verifying Qlik visual outputs against Hive/Impala query results. I worked closely with reporting teams to verify KPI calculations, test drilldowns and filters, and ensure visual integrity across different user roles and access levels. 
For business stakeholders and product owners, I prepared PowerPoint and Excel dashboards to summarize test progress, highlight risks, and illustrate the business impact of technical issues. These visual reports were designed to be non-technical, using charts and annotated visuals to ensure the message was clear and concise. In stakeholder meetings, I walked through these slides to explain anomalies, defect root causes, and resolutions in plain language, and invited feedback to ensure alignment.
For more formal communication and escalations, I created structured reports and maintained RAID logs using Excel and Word, which were shared with senior stakeholders to track issues requiring strategic decisions or resource allocation.
One of my key achievements was during a beta assurance phase where data discrepancies were impacting downstream reporting. I conducted RCAs and discovered logic flaws in transformation rules applied in Hive queries. I documented the issue with screenshots, query results, and impact analysis, and presented it during a stakeholder review. My ability to explain the issue in both technical and business terms enabled swift action and resolution.
Additionally, I ensured continuous feedback loops by organizing "Show and Tell" sessions after each sprint, where I presented outcomes, demonstrated automation results, or walked through test dashboards—including live Qlik visualisation walkthroughs
Leadership and improvement have been consistent themes throughout my career. From mentoring junior engineers to leading ETL and reporting testing teams, and introducing QA process improvements, I’ve shown a proactive approach to leadership.
In conclusion, I offer a rare combination of technical expertise, stakeholder engagement, and a relentless drive for improvement. My experience in Qlik and visualisation testing, adaptability, and commitment to quality uniquely position me to contribute as a Business Analyst in your team, ensuring data-driven insights and effective solutions that align with business goals.
